# Explanation of __init__.py:
# In Python, a file named "__init__.py" is really important. It tells Python that the folder it's in (in this case, "calculator") 
# is a special kind of folder called a "package". Think of a package like a folder that contains related code, like a toolbox with
# different tools inside.
# 
# Without the "__init__.py" file, Python won't know that the folder can be used to group code together. Itâ€™s like a flag that says,
# "Hey Python, this folder can be used to import code!"
# 
# For example, if we put the "__init__.py" file in the "calculator" folder, we can import anything inside it by saying something like:
# "from app.calculator import calculator". The "__init__.py" file can be empty, or it can have code in it, but its main job is just 
# to make the folder a package.
